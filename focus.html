    <h1 style="margin-top: 0em">Research Focus</h1>
	As we work toward deploying machine learning systems in real-world scenarios, 
	the primary considerations of reliability, energy efficiency, and security drive our research efforts. 
	To mitigate potential risks inherent in these systems, our primary focus includes the exploration of two key domains: 
	Statistical Machine Learning and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for energy-efficient and trustworthy AI. 
	
	The former provides fundamental tools for building trustworthy machine learning systems, 
	while the latter focuses on addressing specific risks of some existing machine learning algorithms, such as energy-efficient AI.<br>

	In Statistical Machine Learning, we focus on the basic robust methodologies 
	and leverage statistical principles to enhance the reliability of machine learning systems. 
	In Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we develop training algorithms for energy-efficient and trustworthy AI models. 
	
	The two domains address fundamental aspects through statistical machine learning 
	and address specific challenges posed by existing machine learning algorithms, 
	ensuring the energy-efficiency and reliability of the systems we deploy.

        At the current stage, we mainly focus on developing efficient training algorigthms for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). 
	    And at the same time, we focus on specific tasks to make these training algorithms more reliable and safe.

	<h3>SNN Training Algorithms</h3>
	    Recently, brain-inspired spiking neuron networks (SNNs) have attracted widespread research interest 
	    because of their event-driven and energy-efficient characteristics. 
	    Still, it is difficult to efficiently train deep SNNs due to the non-differentiability of its activation function, 
	    which disables the typically used gradient descent approaches for traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs).
	    So we first need to develop the training algorithms for SNNs, 
	    then we will consider maiking these training algorithms more reliable and safe.

        <h3>Defending against Adversarial Attacks</h3>
        
        Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples that are generated 
	    by changing natural inputs with malicious perturbation, so do SNNs. 
	    Those examples are imperceptible to human eyes but can fool deep models to make wrong predictions with high confidence. 
	    Thus, to make deep neural networks (especially SNNs) more reliable, we focus on the following two topics 
        <ul>
            <li><p>Detecting adversarial attacks for SNNs (i.e., adversarial attack detection). </p></li>
            <li><p>Training a robust model against future adversarial attacks (i.e., adversarial training).</p></li>
        </ul></br>
